This is a technical description of the data for the project. It describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.

## Background to Data
The base data is on human activity recognition using smartphones.The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing, sitting, lying) and three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit, sit-to-stand, sit-to-lie, lie-to-sit, stand-to-lie, and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

## Transforms

1) Apply names to data

2) Clean up variable names



colnames(x_train) <- features[,2] 
colnames(y_train) <-"activityId"
colnames(subject_train) <- "subjectId"

colnames(x_test) <- features[,2] 
colnames(y_test) <- "activityId"
colnames(subject_test) <- "subjectId"

colnames(activityLabels) <- c('activityId','activityType')

mrg_train <- cbind(y_train, subject_train, x_train)
mrg_test <- cbind(y_test, subject_test, x_test)
setAllInOne <- rbind(mrg_train, mrg_test)



## Variables 

Tidy data contains 180 rows and 68 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

Subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. Activity column has 6 types as listed below.

1) WALKING
2) WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4) SITTING
5) STANDING
6) LAYING

Names of Features are labelled using descriptive variable names.

1) t is replaced by time
2) acc is replaced by accelerometer
3) gyro is replaced by gyroscope
4) prefix f is replaced by frequency
5) mag is replaced by magnitude
6) BodyBody is replaced by body

This give us the feature names:
